## IdeaLingua RPC/DML

*IdeaLingua* is an RPC framework & Domain Modeling Language, it’s purpose is to:

* Share & publish APIs and data models in a common concise format
* Allow remote calls to services given their public API definitions.
* Create idiomatic API clients and servers for all programming languages – currently Scala, TypeScript, C# & Go.
* Support frontend-to-backend and backend-to-frontend calls (ala push notifications, via buzzer definitions)
* Abstract away details such as the network protocol or the serialization format.
* Save developers from untyped and brittle REST.

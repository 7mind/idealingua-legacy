## IdeaLingua RPC/DML

[*IdeaLingua*](https://izumi.7mind.io/latest/release/doc/idealingua/index.html) is an RPC framework & Domain Modeling Language, it’s purpose is to:

* Share & publish APIs and data models in a common concise format
* Allow remote calls to services given their public API definitions.
* Create idiomatic API clients and servers for all programming languages – currently Scala, TypeScript, C# & Go.
* Support frontend-to-backend and backend-to-frontend calls (ala push notifications, via buzzer definitions)
* Abstract away details such as the network protocol or the serialization format.
* Save developers from untyped and brittle REST.

*IdeaLingua* is a part of the [Izumi Project](https://github.com/7mind/izumi). Izumi (*jp. 泉水, spring*) is a set of independent libraries and frameworks allowing you to significantly increase productivity of your Scala development.

including the following components:

1. [distage](https://izumi.7mind.io/latest/release/doc/distage/) – Transparent and debuggable Dependency Injection framework for Pure FP Scala,
2. [logstage](https://izumi.7mind.io/latest/release/doc/logstage/) – Automatic structural logs from Scala string interpolations,
3. [idealingua](https://izumi.7mind.io/latest/release/doc/idealingua/) (moved to [7mind/idealingua-v1](https://github.com/7mind/idealingua-v1)) – API Definition, Data Modeling and RPC Language, optimized for fast prototyping – like gRPC, but with a human face. Currently generates servers and clients for Go, TypeScript, C# and Scala,
4. [Opinionated SBT plugins](https://izumi.7mind.io/latest/release/doc/sbt/) (moved to [7mind/sbtgen](https://github.com/7mind/sbtgen)) – Reduces verbosity of SBT builds and introduces new features – inter-project shared test scopes and BOM plugins (from Maven)
5. [Percept-Plan-Execute-Repeat (PPER)](https://izumi.7mind.io/latest/release/doc/pper/) – a pattern that enables modeling very complex domains and orchestrate deadly complex processes a lot easier than you're used to.

Key goals
=========

We aim to provide tools that:

1. Boost productivity and reduce code bloat
2. Are as non-invasive as possible
3. Are introspectable
4. Are better than anything else out there :3

Current state and future plans
==============================

We are looking for early adopters, contributors and sponsors.

This project is currently a work in progress.

In the future we are going to (or may) implement more tools based on PPER approach:

1. Best in the world build system
2. Best in the world cluster orchestration tool
3. Best in the world load testing/macro-benchmark tool
